    "# Proposal for a very private location tracker, for contact tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent a virus from spreading, one approach is to notify people who have a high chance of being recently infected, for self-quarantine and testing. For every person who is newly confirmed as a carrier, their recent location history could be used to identify other people who have been in close proximity. However, most people do not want their location history public. This notebook is a proposal to share location in a cryptographically strong way, while making it likely that a high percentage of people who should be notified would be. They would be *passively* notified, their true identification being strongly encrypted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposal would make both location and personal identification mostly private:\n",
    "1. Trusted location and personal \"authorities\" could separately decrypt some of the information. (More than one authority could be used by each person for each type of information).\n",
    "1. Full personal identification is possible only with encrypted information stored on device. \n",
    "1. The on-device store would destroy entries older than a set time, such that data from earlier than some number of days would be untraceable.\n",
    "1. Requests for decryption could be further limited to trusted medical providers by agreement with PersonalAuthority's.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a user already trusts a provider (e.g. map app) with their location data, the provider could act as an \"on-device store\". That way a user could opt in to this service by simply opting in from their existing trusted app(s). Note, if trusted provider acts as an on-device store, the user would be *actively* notified by the trusted provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposals require two publically available log files (on the cloud). Public, encrypted messages, including *passive* notification, are listed below like:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` diff \n",
    "- red ``` \n",
    "\n",
    "On-device storage messages are formatted as:\n",
    "``` diff\n",
    "+ green ``` \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, public keys for both types of authorities must be shared.\n",

    "  1. Without access to an on-device store, but with access to the private keys of all the Location and Personal Authorities, an external agent could detect whether a location had at least one person at a time, and can estimate a plausible range of number of people there. However, the agent could not figure out who exactly, because the only available personal identification would be a single-use random number. \n",
    "  1. With access to the on-device store, and subpoenas at the Location and Personal Authorities, it is possible to track where a person went, provided the app was enabled in the time window of interest, and the time window was within the `time_interval_to_keep` as enforced in the on-device store. It is possible to know that some other people were co-located, but without their on-device store, it should be close to impossible to prove who those people were, using only data contained in this design. The main weak point would be network traces when Log entries were made.\n",
